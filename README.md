# Amazon IVS manifest clipping solution
The Amazon IVS manifest clipping solution offers a reference solution that demonstrates how you can use HTTP live streaming (HLS) Program-Date-Time (PDT) tags and HLS byte range manifest files to clip the recordings stored on [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) using the [Auto-Record to Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ivs/latest/userguide/record-to-s3.html).

The solution offers two deployment options: 
- **[A. Application Web UI + APIs:](#option-a---deploy-the-complete-solution-application-web-ui--apis)** A front-end UI with backend APIs that offers a complete set to clip the recordings.
- **[B. Standalone API:](#option-b---deploy-the-standalone-api)** For developers only needing a reference clip API.


This is a serverless web application leveraging [Amazon IVS](https://aws.amazon.com/ivs/), [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) and [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/). The sample Web UI is an application page built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [VideoJS](https://videojs.com/). The back-end is built using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), Amazon API Gateway, and AWS Lambda function used to [list all Amazon IVS recordings](/serverless/lambdas/getrecordings/), to [clip/trim the recordings](/serverless/lambdas/clipmanifest/) and [list all clipped recordings](/serverless/lambdas/getclips/). It also uses [AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/), an open-source framework for building serverless applications.

## Prerequisites

- AWS CLI ([Installing or updating the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html))
- AWS SAM CLI ([Installing the AWS SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html))
- NodeJS ([Installing Node.js](https://nodejs.org/))
- AWS Account: If you do not have an AWS account, please see [How do I create and activate a new Amazon Web Services account?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)


## Getting Started
 ⚠️**IMPORTANT NOTE:** *Deploying this demo application in your AWS account will create and consume AWS resources, which will cost money.*

**Deployment Options:**

### Option A - [Deploy the complete solution (Application Web UI + APIs)](/serverless/README.md)
This option implements the complete solution with the back-end APIs needed for retrieving the recorded streams from Amazon IVS, clipping, and listing the clips.
- **[Application Web UI + APIs](/serverless/README.md)**  
Deploy the Application UI, back-end AWS Lambda functions [clipmanifest](/serverless/lambdas/clipmanifest/), [getclips](/serverless/lambdas/getclips/) and [getrecordings](/serverless/lambdas/getrecordings/).

### Option B - [Deploy the standalone API](/standalone-api/README.md)
This option implements only the clip manifest API. Therefore, it suits developers who already have an application to integrate with the clipmanifest API. 

- **[Standalone API](/standalone-api/README.md)**  
Deploy the backend AWS Lambda functions [clipmanifest](/serverless/lambdas/clipmanifest/).
